        <h3>About</h3>
        Here you will be able to access all the events available to employees of Rural Sourcing.
        This calendar will consolidate the various events held for our colleagues and communities,
        such as: game nights, monthly round-ups, softball league games, Greenjackets baseball events,
        Tech Tuesday learning presentations, etc. This will give you a way to keep track of the
        events going on without interfering with your personal calendar.
